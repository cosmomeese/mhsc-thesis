abstract = {Background: Previous trials of heart failure telemonitoring systems have produced inconsistent findings, largely due to diverse interventions and study designs. Objectives: The objectives of this study are (1) to provide in-depth insight into the effects of telemonitoring on self-care and clinical management, and (2) to determine the features that enable successful heart failure telemonitoring. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 heart failure patients attending a heart function clinic who had used a mobile phone-based telemonitoring system for 6 months. The telemonitoring system required the patients to take daily weight and blood pressure readings, weekly single-lead ECGs, and to answer daily symptom questions on a mobile phone. Instructions were sent to the patient's mobile phone based on their physiological values. Alerts were also sent to a cardiologist's mobile phone, as required. All clinicians involved in the study were also interviewed post-trial (N = 5). The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and then analyzed using a conventional content analysis approach. Results: The telemonitoring system improved patient self-care by instructing the patients in real-time how to appropriately modify their lifestyle behaviors. Patients felt more aware of their heart failure condition, less anxiety, and more empowered. Many were willing to partially fund the use of the system. The clinicians were able to manage their patients' heart failure conditions more effectively, because they had physiological data reported to them frequently to help in their decision-making (eg, for medication titration) and were alerted at the earliest sign of decompensation. Essential characteristics of the telemonitoring system that contributed to improved heart failure management included immediate self-care and clinical feedback (ie, teachable moments), how the system was easy and quick to use, and how the patients and clinicians perceived tangible benefits from telemonitoring. Some clinical concerns included ongoing costs of the telemonitoring system and increased clinical workload. A few patients did not want to be watched long-term while some were concerned they might become dependent on the system. Conclusions: The success of a telemonitoring system is highly dependent on its features and design. The essential system characteristics identified in this study should be considered when developing telemonitoring solutions.

abstract = {Background: The use of expert systems to generate automated alerts and patient instructions based on telemonitoring data could enable increased self-care and improve clinical management. However, of great importance is the development of the rule set to ensure safe and clinically relevant alerts and instructions are sent. The purpose of this work was to develop a rule-based expert system for a heart failure mobile phone-based telemonitoring system, to evaluate the expert system, and to generalize the lessons learned from the development process for use in other healthcare applications. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 heart failure clinicians to inform the development of a draft heart failure rule set for alerts and patient instructions. The draft rule set was validated and refined with 9 additional interviews with heart failure clinicians. Finally, the clinical champion of the project vetted the rule set. The concerns voiced by the clinicians during the interviews were noted, and methods to mitigate these concerns were employed. The rule set was then evaluated as part of a 6-month randomized controlled trial of a mobile phone-based heart failure telemonitoring system (n= 50 for each of the telemonitoring and control groups). Results: The developed expert system generated alerts and instructions based on the patient's weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and symptoms. During the trial, 1620 alerts were generated, which led to various clinical actions including 105 medication changes/instructions. The findings from the trial indicated the rule set was associated with improved quality of life and self-care. Conclusions: A rule set was developed with extensive input by heart failure clinicians. The results from the trial indicated the rule set was associated with significantly increased self-care and improved the clinical management of heart failure. The developed rule set can be used as a basis for other heart failure telemonitoring systems, but should be validated and modified as necessary. In addition, the process used to develop the rule set can be generalized and applied to create robust and complete rule sets for other healthcare expert systems. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {E xercise testing remains a remarkably durable and versa-tile tool that provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information regarding patients with cardiovascular and pul-monary disease. Exercise testing has been available for more than a half century and, like many other cardiovascular procedures, has evolved in its technology and scope. When combined with exercise testing, adjunctive imaging modali-ties offer greater diagnostic accuracy, additional information regarding cardiac structure and function, and additional prognostic information. Similarly, the addition of ventilatory gas exchange measurements during exercise testing provides a wide array of unique and clinically useful incremental information that heretofore has been poorly understood and underutilized by the practicing clinician. The reasons for this are many and include the requirement for additional equip-ment (cardiopulmonary exercise testing [CPX] systems), personnel who are proficient in the administration and inter-pretation of these tests, limited or absence of training of cardiovascular specialists and limited training by pulmonary specialists in this technique, and the lack of understanding of the value of CPX by practicing clinicians. Modern CPX systems allow for the analysis of gas ex-change at rest, during exercise, and during recovery and yield breath-by-breath measures of oxygen uptake (V ˙ O 2), carbon dioxide output (V ˙ CO 2), and ventilation (V ˙ E). These advanced computerized systems provide both simple and complex analyses of these data that are easy to retrieve and store, which makes CPX available for widespread use. These data can be readily integrated with standard variables measured during exercise testing, including heart rate, blood pressure, work rate, electrocardiography findings, and symptoms, to provide a comprehensive assessment of exercise tolerance and exercise responses. CPX can even be performed with adjunctive imaging modalities for additional diagnostic as-sessment. Hence, CPX offers the clinician the ability to obtain a wealth of information beyond standard exercise electrocardiography testing that when appropriately applied and interpreted can assist in the management of complex cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. Although CPX has long been used in the assessment of athletic performance and in research venues, its burgeoning value in the clinical setting has prompted the American Heart Association to convene a writing group of experts in the field to generate this " Clinician's Guide to Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing in Adults. " The purpose of this document is to supplement existing exercise testing guidelines with a},

abstract = {Objectives: This study sought to define the prognostic significance and clinical determinants of the 6-min walk distance (6-MWD) in affected patients. Background: Symptoms of exertional fatigue and dyspnea, as well as a reduced exercise tolerance, arecardinal features of pulmonary hypertension associated with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction(PH-HFpEF). Mechanisms limiting exercise capacity in this specific entity remain incompletely understood. Methods: Consecutive patients with PH-HFpEF, as confirmed by right heart catheter, were enrolled in our prospective registry. Hospitalization for HF and/or death for cardiac reasons were defined as primary outcome. Multiple regression models were constructed to establish determinants of the 6-MWD. For quantification of left ventricular (LV) extracellular matrix (ECM), myocardial biopsies were taken from 18 patients. Results: Between December 2010 and July 2013, 142 PH-HFpEF patients were included in the study. After a mean follow-up of 14.0 ?? 10.0 months, 43 patients (30.3{\%}) reached the combined endpoint. The 6-MWD was found to be an independent predictor of outcome and was influenced by a variety of clinical, echocardiographic, hemodynamic, laboratory, and pulmonary parameters. There was a significant inverse correlation between the 6-MWD and the extent of ECM in the LV myocardium. Conclusions: Impaired exercise capacity in PH-HFpEF patients is explained by cardiac and noncardiac factors. The6-MWD predicts outcome and may be a useful endpoint in clinical trials.},

abstract = {Prescription of an appropriate dialysis target weight (dry weight) requires accurate evaluation of the degree of hydration. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a state of normal hydration (DW(cBIS)) as defined by calf bioimpedance spectroscopy (cBIS) and conventional whole body bioimpedance spectroscopy (wBIS) could be characterized in hemodialysis (HD) patients and normal subjects (NS). wBIS and cBIS were performed in 62 NS (33 m/29 f) and 30 HD patients (16 m/14 f) pre- and post-dialysis treatments to measure extracellular resistance and fluid volume (ECV) by the whole body and calf bioimpedance methods. Normalized calf resistivity ($\rho$(N)(,5)) was defined as resistivity at 5 kHz divided by the body mass index. The ratio of wECV to total body water (wECV/TBW) was calculated. Measurements were made at baseline (BL) and at DW(cBIS) following the progressive reduction of post-HD weight over successive dialysis treatments until the curve of calf extracellular resistance is flattened (stabilization) and the $\rho$(N)(,5) was in the range of NS. Blood pressures were measured pre- and post-HD treatment. $\rho$(N)(,5) in males and females differed significantly in NS. In patients, $\rho$(N)(,5) notably increased with progressive decrease in body weight, and systolic blood pressure significantly decreased pre- and post-HD between BL and DW(cBIS) respectively. Although wECV/TBW decreased between BL and DW(cBIS), the percentage of change in wECV/TBW was significantly less than that in $\rho$(N)(,5) (-5.21 ± 3.2{\%} versus 28 ± 27{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). This establishes the use of $\rho$(N)(,5) as a new comparator allowing a clinician to incrementally monitor removal of extracellular fluid from patients over the course of dialysis treatments. The conventional whole body technique using wECV/TBW was less sensitive than the use of $\rho$(N)(,5) to measure differences in body hydration between BL and DW(cBIS).},

abstract = {Background: Our purpose was to evaluate the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) in patients with heart failure (HF) enrolled in the Randomized Evaluation of Strategies for Left Ventricular Dysfunction (RESOLVD) pilot study. Methods: A total of 768 patients was enrolled in a multicenter randomized clinical trial evaluating the effect of candesartan, enalapril, and metoprolol on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), 6MWT distance, neurohormones, and quality of life. The 6MWT was performed once at screening and twice at baseline, 18 weeks, and 43 weeks by a standardized method. Results: Test-retest reliability at baseline (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.90), 18 weeks (ICC = 0.88), and 43 weeks (ICC = 0.91) was very good. Baseline 6MWT distance was weakly inversely correlated to the quality-of-life cumulative score (r = -0.26, P = .0001) and moderately inversely correlated to the New York Heart Association functional classification (NYHA-FC) (r = -0.43, P = .001). In the RESOLVD study, the 6MWT was not responsive to change when effect sizes and standardized response means were used. Disease-specific quality of life was responsive to change in patients treated with candesartan and enalapril and NYHA-FC was responsive to change in the candesartan and enalapril combination and for enalapril alone with small effect sizes. The 6MWT, NYHA-FC, and quality of life were not responsive to change during the metoprolol or placebo phase. Conclusions: The 6MWT is highly reproducible in patients with symptoms of HF. It is somewhat correlated to NYHA-FC and quality of life. Overall, quality of life was most responsive to change, whereas 6MWT and NYHA-FC were comparable but less responsive to change in the RESOLVD study.},

abstract = {Chronic disease, such as diabetes, chronic heart failure, and asthma, is the leading cause of death and disability and has great impact on the healthcare budget. Healthcare organizations, such as managed care organizations, are seeking analytics tools to better conduct and monitor the performance of chronic disease management. We propose a semi-Markov based chronic disease progression model to model multi-state chronic disease transitions by taking into consideration of the length of time that patients have stayed in a certain disease state. A proportional hazard model is incorporated into the semi-Markov model to model the impacts of risk factors. We also propose a disease state classifier using claim-based features, such as drug use, medical procedures, and office visits. Our model can handle data with both left censoring and right censoring.},

abstract = {Background: Patient activity (PA) has been demonstrated to predict
all-cause mortality. However, the association between PA and cardiac
death is unclear.
Aims: The aims of this study were to determine whether PA can predict
cardiac death and what is the cut-off of PA to discriminate cardiac
death, as well as the mechanism underlying the relationship between PA
and survival in patients with home monitoring.
Methods: This study retrospectively analysed clinical and implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator/cardiac resynchronization therapy
defibrillator device data in 845 patients. Data regarding PA and PP
variability during the first 30-60 days of home monitoring were
collected, and mean values were calculated. The primary endpoint was
cardiac death, and the secondary endpoint was all-cause mortality.
Results: The mean PA percentage was 11 +/- 5.8{\%}. Based on receiver
operating characteristic curve analysis, we determined that a PA cut-off
value of 7.84{\%} (113 min) can predict cardiac death. During a mean
follow-up period of 31.1 +/- 12.9 months (ranging from three to 60
months), PA {\textless}= 7.84{\%} was associated with increased risks of cardiac
death in an unadjusted analysis; after adjusting in a multivariate Cox
model, the relationship remained significant between PA {\textless}= 7.84{\%} and
cardiac death (hazard ratio = 3.644, 95{\%} confidence interval =
2.424-5.477, p {\textless} 0.001). Moreover, a significant correlation was
observed between PA and PP variability (r = 0.601, p {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions: A baseline PA {\textless}= 7.84{\%} was associated with a higher risk
of cardiac death in patients who have survived more than three months
after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator/cardiac resynchronization
therapy defibrillator implantation. PA had a sizable effect on heart
rate variability, reflecting autonomic function.},

High-profile Internet firms such as Ama-zon, Etsy, Facebook, Flickr, Google, and Netflix have embraced continuous deployment. However, the practice has not been cov-ered in textbooks and no scientific publication has presented an analysis of continuous deployment. In this paper, we describe the continuous deployment practices at two very different firms: Facebook and OANDA. We show that continuous deployment does not inhibit productivity or quality even in the face of substantial engineering team and code size growth. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show it is possible to scale the size of an engineering team by 20X and the size of the code base by 50X without negatively impact-ing developer productivity or software quality. Our experience suggests that top-level management support of continuous de-ployment is necessary, and that given a choice, developers prefer faster deployment. We identify elements we feel make continuous deployment viable and present observations from operating in a continuous deployment environment.},

In this paper, we present an accelerometer-based personal life log system capable of human activity classification and exercise information generation. In our system, we use a tri-axial accelerometer and a real-time activity recognition scheme in which a set of augmented features of accelerometer signals, processed with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), is classified by our hierarchical artificial neural network classifier: in the lower level of the classifier, a state of an activity is recognized based on the statistical and spectral features; in the upper level, an activity is recognized with a set of augmented features including autoregressive (AR) coefficients, signal magnitude area (SMA), and tilt angles (TA). Upon the recognition of each activity, we further estimate exercise information such as energy expenditure based on Metabolic Equivalents (METS), step count, walking distance, walking speed, activity duration, etc. Our PLL system functions in real-time and all information generated from our system is archived in a daily-log database. By testing our system on seven different daily activities, we have obtained an average accuracy of 84.8{\%} in activity recognition and generated their relative exercise information.},

abstract = {One of the key objectives of the Behavioural Insights Team at its creation in 2010 was to spread the understanding of behavioural approaches across the policy community. Alongside the policy work and trials conducted by the Team over the last three years, we have conducted many seminars, workshops and talks with policy makers, academics and practitioners. From these many sessions, together with our trials and policy work, has emerged a simple, pragmatic framework to help think about behaviour change. In the early years, we often used the MINDSPACE framework, and indeed some of the team were centrally involved in developing it.1 We still use this framework. But we found in seminars that its nine elements were hard for busy policy makers to keep in mind (itself reflecting ‘cognitive chunking'). At the same time, we found in our day-to-day trials and policy work that some of the most reliable effects came from changes that weren't easily captured by MINDSPACE, or indeed by much of the academic literature. For example, we have often found that simplifying messages, or removing even the tiniest amount of ‘friction' in a process, can have a large impact. For these reasons, we wanted to develop a shorter, simple mnemonic — the EAST framework. The EAST framework was developed by the Behavioural Insights Team from early 2012. After initial testing in seminars given by members of the team with UK Civil Servants, the first public ‘outing' of EAST in its final form was in a short series of lectures I gave in Harvard and Washington later that year. Since then, we have refined and developed some of the core concepts and ideas, based on new findings and feedback from those we have tested EAST with. I would stress that, like most of what BIT does, it is very much the work of the team, and many have contributed to it – not least our friend and colleague Richard Thaler whose mantra is to ‘make it easy'. We hope you find this guide helpful. Getting familiar with the EAST framework won't turn you into the world's leading expert on behavioural insight. There are more complex frameworks and typologies, and many subtle and fascinating effects that EAST does not cover. But if even a small percentage of policies and practices are adapted as a result, EAST should lead to services that are easier and more pleasant for citizens to use, and more effective and cheaper too.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Health technologies are being developed to help people living at home manage long-term conditions. One such technology is "lifestyle monitoring" (LM), a telecare technology based on the idea that home activities may be monitored unobtrusively via sensors to give an indication of changes in health-state. However, questions remain about LM technology: how home activities change when participants experience differing health-states; and how sensors might capture clinically important changes to inform timely interventions. OBJECTIVE The objective of this paper was to report the findings of a study aimed at identifying changes in activity indicative of important changes in health in people with long-term conditions, particularly changes indicative of exacerbation, by exploring the relationship between home activities and health among people with heart failure (HF). We aimed to add to the knowledge base informing the development of home monitoring technologies designed to detect health deterioration in order to facilitate early intervention and avoid hospital admissions. METHODS This qualitative study utilized semistructured interviews to explore everyday activities undertaken during the three health-states of HF: normal days, bad days, and exacerbations. Potential recruits were identified by specialist nurses and attendees at an HF support group. The sample was purposively selected to include a range of experience of living with HF. RESULTS The sample comprised a total of 20 people with HF aged 50 years and above, and 11 spouses or partners of the individuals with HF. All resided in Northern England. Participant accounts revealed that home activities are in part shaped by the degree of intrusion from HF symptoms. During an exacerbation, participants undertook activities specifically to ease symptoms, and detailed activity changes were identified. Everyday activity was also influenced by a range of factors other than health. CONCLUSIONS The study highlights the importance of careful development of LM technology to identify changes in activities that occur during clinically important changes in health. These detailed activity changes need to be considered by developers of LM sensors, platforms, and algorithms intended to detect early signs of deterioration. Results suggest that for LM to move forward, sensor set-up should be personalized to individual circumstances and targeted at individual health conditions. LM needs to take account of the uncertainties that arise from placing technology within the home, in order to inform sensor set-up and data interpretation. This targeted approach is likely to yield more clinically meaningful data and address some of the ethical issues of remote monitoring.},

Discharge heart rate was categorized into predefined groups: 40 to 60 (n=1333), 61 to 70 (n=2170), 71 to 80 (n=2631), 81 to 90 (n=1700), and {\textgreater}90 bpm (n=1263). There was a significant increase in all-cause 30-day mortality with adjusted odds ratios of 1.59 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.18-2.14; P=0.003) for discharge heart rates 81 to 90 bpm and 1.56 (95{\%} CI, 1.13-2.16; P=0.007) for heart rates{\textgreater}90 bpm when compared with the reference group (heart rates, 61-70 bpm).

abstract = {BACKGROUND Health care literature supports the development of accessible interventions that integrate behavioral economics, wearable devices, principles of evidence-based behavior change, and community support. However, there are limited real-world examples of large scale, population-based, member-driven reward platforms. Subsequently, a paucity of outcome data exists and health economic effects remain largely theoretical. To complicate matters, an emerging area of research is defining the role of Superusers, the small percentage of unusually engaged digital health participants who may influence other members. OBJECTIVE The objective of this preliminary study is to analyze descriptive data from GOODcoins, a self-guided, free-to-consumer engagement and rewards platform incentivizing walking, running and cycling. Registered members accessed the GOODcoins platform through PCs, tablets or mobile devices, and had the opportunity to sync wearables to track activity. Following registration, members were encouraged to join gamified group challenges and compare their progress with that of others. As members met challenge targets, they were rewarded with GOODcoins, which could be redeemed for planet- or people-friendly products. METHODS Outcome data were obtained from the GOODcoins custom SQL database. The reporting period was December 1, 2014 to May 1, 2015. Descriptive self-report data were analyzed using MySQL and MS Excel. RESULTS The study period includes data from 1298 users who were connected to an exercise tracking device. Females consisted of 52.6{\%} (n=683) of the study population, 33.7{\%} (n=438) were between the ages of 20-29, and 24.8{\%} (n=322) were between the ages of 30-39. 77.5{\%} (n=1006) of connected and active members met daily-recommended physical activity guidelines of 30 minutes, with a total daily average activity of 107 minutes (95{\%} CI 90, 124). Of all connected and active users, 96.1{\%} (n=1248) listed walking as their primary activity. For members who exchanged GOODcoins, the mean balance was 4,000 (95{\%} CI 3850, 4150) at time of redemption, and 50.4{\%} (n=61) of exchanges were for fitness or outdoor products, while 4.1{\%} (n=5) were for food-related items. Participants were most likely to complete challenges when rewards were between 201-300 GOODcoins. CONCLUSIONS The purpose of this study is to form a baseline for future research. Overall, results indicate that challenges and incentives may be effective for connected and active members, and may play a role in achieving daily-recommended activity guidelines. Registrants were typically younger, walking was the primary activity, and rewards were mainly exchanged for fitness or outdoor products. Remaining to be determined is whether members were already physically active at time of registration and are representative of healthy adherers, or were previously inactive and were incentivized to change their behavior. As challenges are gamified, there is an opportunity to investigate the role of superusers and healthy adherers, impacts on behavioral norms, and how cooperative games and incentives can be leveraged across stratified populations. Study limitations and future research agendas are discussed.},

abstract = {Background: The use of expert systems to generate automated alerts and patient instructions based on telemonitoring data could enable increased self-care and improve clinical management. However, of great importance is the development of the rule set to ensure safe and clinically relevant alerts and instructions are sent. The purpose of this work was to develop a rule-based expert system for a heart failure mobile phone-based telemonitoring system, to evaluate the expert system, and to generalize the lessons learned from the development process for use in other healthcare applications. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 heart failure clinicians to inform the development of a draft heart failure rule set for alerts and patient instructions. The draft rule set was validated and refined with 9 additional interviews with heart failure clinicians. Finally, the clinical champion of the project vetted the rule set. The concerns voiced by the clinicians during the interviews were noted, and methods to mitigate these concerns were employed. The rule set was then evaluated as part of a 6-month randomized controlled trial of a mobile phone-based heart failure telemonitoring system (n= 50 for each of the telemonitoring and control groups). Results: The developed expert system generated alerts and instructions based on the patient's weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and symptoms. During the trial, 1620 alerts were generated, which led to various clinical actions including 105 medication changes/instructions. The findings from the trial indicated the rule set was associated with improved quality of life and self-care. Conclusions: A rule set was developed with extensive input by heart failure clinicians. The results from the trial indicated the rule set was associated with significantly increased self-care and improved the clinical management of heart failure. The developed rule set can be used as a basis for other heart failure telemonitoring systems, but should be validated and modified as necessary. In addition, the process used to develop the rule set can be generalized and applied to create robust and complete rule sets for other healthcare expert systems. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Whereas the economic evaluation of pharmaceuticals is an established practice within international health technology assessment (HTA) and is often produced with the support of comprehensive methodological guidance, the equivalent procedure for medical devices is less developed. Medical devices, including diagnostic products, are a rapidly growing market in healthcare, with over 10,000 medical technology patent applications filed in Europe in 2012-nearly double the number filed for pharmaceuticals. This increase in the market place, in combination with the limited, or constricting, budgets that healthcare decision makers face, has led to a greater level of examination with respect to the economic evaluation of medical devices. However, methodological questions that arise due to the unique characteristics of medical devices have yet to be addressed fully. This review of journal publications and HTA guidance identified these characteristics and the challenges they may subsequently pose from an economic evaluation perspective. These unique features of devices can be grouped into four categories: (1) data quality issues; (2) learning curve; (3) measuring long-term outcomes from diagnostic devices; and (4) wider impact from organisational change. We review the current evaluation toolbox available to researchers and explore potential future approaches to improve the economic evaluation of medical devices.},

@article{Hargreaves2017a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Health technologies are being developed to help people living at home manage long-term conditions. One such technology is "lifestyle monitoring" (LM), a telecare technology based on the idea that home activities may be monitored unobtrusively via sensors to give an indication of changes in health-state. However, questions remain about LM technology: how home activities change when participants experience differing health-states; and how sensors might capture clinically important changes to inform timely interventions. OBJECTIVE The objective of this paper was to report the findings of a study aimed at identifying changes in activity indicative of important changes in health in people with long-term conditions, particularly changes indicative of exacerbation, by exploring the relationship between home activities and health among people with heart failure (HF). We aimed to add to the knowledge base informing the development of home monitoring technologies designed to detect health deterioration in order to facilitate early intervention and avoid hospital admissions. METHODS This qualitative study utilized semistructured interviews to explore everyday activities undertaken during the three health-states of HF: normal days, bad days, and exacerbations. Potential recruits were identified by specialist nurses and attendees at an HF support group. The sample was purposively selected to include a range of experience of living with HF. RESULTS The sample comprised a total of 20 people with HF aged 50 years and above, and 11 spouses or partners of the individuals with HF. All resided in Northern England. Participant accounts revealed that home activities are in part shaped by the degree of intrusion from HF symptoms. During an exacerbation, participants undertook activities specifically to ease symptoms, and detailed activity changes were identified. Everyday activity was also influenced by a range of factors other than health. CONCLUSIONS The study highlights the importance of careful development of LM technology to identify changes in activities that occur during clinically important changes in health. These detailed activity changes need to be considered by developers of LM sensors, platforms, and algorithms intended to detect early signs of deterioration. Results suggest that for LM to move forward, sensor set-up should be personalized to individual circumstances and targeted at individual health conditions. LM needs to take account of the uncertainties that arise from placing technology within the home, in order to inform sensor set-up and data interpretation. This targeted approach is likely to yield more clinically meaningful data and address some of the ethical issues of remote monitoring.},

@article{Seto2012a,
abstract = {Background: Previous trials of heart failure telemonitoring systems have produced inconsistent findings, largely due to diverse interventions and study designs. Objectives: The objectives of this study are (1) to provide in-depth insight into the effects of telemonitoring on self-care and clinical management, and (2) to determine the features that enable successful heart failure telemonitoring. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 heart failure patients attending a heart function clinic who had used a mobile phone-based telemonitoring system for 6 months. The telemonitoring system required the patients to take daily weight and blood pressure readings, weekly single-lead ECGs, and to answer daily symptom questions on a mobile phone. Instructions were sent to the patient's mobile phone based on their physiological values. Alerts were also sent to a cardiologist's mobile phone, as required. All clinicians involved in the study were also interviewed post-trial (N = 5). The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and then analyzed using a conventional content analysis approach. Results: The telemonitoring system improved patient self-care by instructing the patients in real-time how to appropriately modify their lifestyle behaviors. Patients felt more aware of their heart failure condition, less anxiety, and more empowered. Many were willing to partially fund the use of the system. The clinicians were able to manage their patients' heart failure conditions more effectively, because they had physiological data reported to them frequently to help in their decision-making (eg, for medication titration) and were alerted at the earliest sign of decompensation. Essential characteristics of the telemonitoring system that contributed to improved heart failure management included immediate self-care and clinical feedback (ie, teachable moments), how the system was easy and quick to use, and how the patients and clinicians perceived tangible benefits from telemonitoring. Some clinical concerns included ongoing costs of the telemonitoring system and increased clinical workload. A few patients did not want to be watched long-term while some were concerned they might become dependent on the system. Conclusions: The success of a telemonitoring system is highly dependent on its features and design. The essential system characteristics identified in this study should be considered when developing telemonitoring solutions.

abstract = {The goal of this research was to use a heuristic evaluation methodology to uncover design and interface deficiencies of infusion pumps that are currently in use in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Because these infusion systems cannot be readily replaced due to lease agreements and large-scale institutional purchasing procedures, we argue that it is essential to systematically identify the existing usability problems so that the possible causes of errors can be better understood, passed on to the end-users (e.g., critical care nurses), and used to make policy recommendations. Four raters conducted the heuristic evaluation of the three-channel infusion pump interface. Three raters had a cognitive science background as well as experience with the heuristic evaluation methodology. The fourth rater was a veteran critical care nurse who had extensive experience operating the pumps. The usability experts and the domain expert independently evaluated the user interface and physical design of the infusion pump and generated a list of heuristic violations based upon a set of 14 heuristics developed in previous research. The lists were compiled and then rated on the severity of the violation. From 14 usability heuristics considered in this evaluation of the Infusion Pump, there were 231 violations. Two heuristics, "Consistency" and "Language", were found to have the most violations. The one with fewest violations was "Document". While some heuristic evaluation categories had more violations than others, the most severe ones were not confined to one type. The Primary interface location (e.g., where loading the pump, changing doses, and confirming drug settings takes place) had the most occurrences of heuristic violations. We believe that the Heuristic Evaluation methodology provides a simple and cost-effective approach to discovering medical device deficiencies that affect a patient's general well being. While this methodology provides information for the infusion pump designs of the future, it also identifies important insights concerning equipment that is currently in use in critical care environments. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Research on the influence of socioeconomic status (SES) on heavy drinking of alcohol has provided contradictory findings. A limitation of the literature is that studies have primarily measured SES at one point in time. Inspired by the life course perspective and sociological research on chronic stress, this study uses data from the US National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979-1992 wave) to examine whether the duration of poverty and unemployment is a risk factor for heavy drinking. Results from logistic and ordinary least squares regression analyses demonstrate that longer durations of poverty and involuntary unemployment across a span of 13 years significantly predict being a heavy drinker and more frequent heavy drinking at ages 27-35 years. These effects are independent of gender, age, race/ethnicity, marital status, prior heavy drinking, and present SES. Overall, this study contributes to the literature that histories of poverty and involuntary unemployment have lasting effects on heavy drinking. More studies should use longitudinal data to explore the temporal dimension of SES. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: In 2008, the United States spent {\$}2.2 trillion for healthcare, which was 15.5{\%} of its GDP. 31{\%} of this expenditure is attributed to hospital care. Evidently, even modest reductions in hospital care costs matter. A 2009 study showed that nearly {\$}30.8 billion in hospital care cost during 2006 was potentially preventable, with heart diseases being responsible for about 31{\%} of that amount. Methods: Our goal is to accurately and efficiently predict heart-related hospitalizations based on the available patient-specific medical history. To the best of our knowledge, the approaches we introduce are novel for this problem. The prediction of hospitalization is formulated as a supervised classification problem. We use de-identified Electronic Health Record (EHR) data from a large urban hospital in Boston to identify patients with heart diseases. Patients are labeled and randomly partitioned into a training and a test set. We apply five machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), AdaBoost using trees as the weak learner, logistic regression, a na??ve Bayes event classifier, and a variation of a Likelihood Ratio Test adapted to the specific problem. Each model is trained on the training set and then tested on the test set. Results: All five models show consistent results, which could, to some extent, indicate the limit of the achievable prediction accuracy. Our results show that with under 30{\%} false alarm rate, the detection rate could be as high as 82{\%}. These accuracy rates translate to a considerable amount of potential savings, if used in practice.},

abstract = {Continuous deployment is the practice of releasing software updates to production as soon as it is ready, which is receiv-ing increased adoption in industry. The frequency of updates of mobile software has traditionally lagged the state of prac-tice for cloud-based services for a number of reasons. Mobile versions can only be released periodically. Users can choose when and if to upgrade, which means that several different releases coexist in production. There are hundreds of An-droid hardware variants, which increases the risk of having errors in the software being deployed. Facebook has made significant progress in increasing the frequency of its mobile deployments. Over a period of 4 years, the Android release has gone from a deployment ev-ery 8 weeks to a deployment every week. In this paper, we describe in detail the mobile deployment process at FB. We present our findings from an extensive analysis of software engineering metrics based on data collected over a period of 7 years. A key finding is that the frequency of deployment does not directly affect developer productivity or software quality. We argue that this finding is due to the fact that increasing the frequency of continuous deployment forces im-proved release and deployment automation, which in turn re-duces developer workload. Additionally, the data we present shows that dog-fooding and obtaining feedback from alpha and beta customers is critical to maintaining release quality.},

The aim of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of ten consumer activity trackers for measuring step count in both laboratory and free-living conditions. METHOD Healthy adult volunteers (n = 33) walked twice on a treadmill (4.8 km/h) for 30 min while wearing ten different activity trackers (i.e. Lumoback, Fitbit Flex, Jawbone Up, Nike+ Fuelband SE, Misfit Shine, Withings Pulse, Fitbit Zip, Omron HJ-203, Yamax Digiwalker SW-200 and Moves mobile application). In free-living conditions, 56 volunteers wore the same activity trackers for one working day. Test-retest reliability was analyzed with the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Validity was evaluated by comparing each tracker with the gold standard (Optogait system for laboratory and ActivPAL for free-living conditions), using paired samples t-tests, mean absolute percentage errors, correlations and Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS Test-retest analysis revealed high reliability for most trackers except for the Omron (ICC .14), Moves app (ICC .37) and Nike+ Fuelband (ICC .53). The mean absolute percentage errors of the trackers in laboratory and free-living conditions respectively, were: Lumoback (-0.2, -0.4), Fibit Flex (-5.7, 3.7), Jawbone Up (-1.0, 1.4), Nike+ Fuelband (-18, -24), Misfit Shine (0.2, 1.1), Withings Pulse (-0.5, -7.9), Fitbit Zip (-0.3, 1.2), Omron (2.5, -0.4), Digiwalker (-1.2, -5.9), and Moves app (9.6, -37.6). Bland-Altman plots demonstrated that the limits of agreement varied from 46 steps (Fitbit Zip) to 2422 steps (Nike+ Fuelband) in the laboratory condition, and 866 steps (Fitbit Zip) to 5150 steps (Moves app) in the free-living condition. CONCLUSION The reliability and validity of most trackers for measuring step count is good. The Fitbit Zip is the most valid whereas the reliability and validity of the Nike+ Fuelband is low.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Whether heart rate upon discharge following hospitalization for heart failure is associated with long-term adverse outcomes and whether this association differs between patients with sinus rhythm (SR) and atrial fibrillation (AF) have not been well studied. METHODS AND RESULTS We conducted a retrospective cohort study from clinical registry data linked to Medicare claims for 46 217 patients participating in Get With The Guidelines({\textregistered})-Heart Failure. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate the association between discharge heart rate and all-cause mortality, all-cause readmission, and the composite outcome of mortality/readmission through 1 year. For SR and AF patients with heart rate ≥75, the association between heart rate and mortality (expressed as hazard ratio [HR] per 10 beats-per-minute increment) was significant at 0 to 30 days (SR: HR 1.30, 95{\%} CI 1.22 to 1.39; AF: HR 1.23, 95{\%} CI 1.16 to 1.29) and 31 to 365 days (SR: HR 1.15, 95{\%} CI 1.12 to 1.20; AF: HR 1.05, 95{\%} CI 1.01 to 1.08). Similar associations between heart rate and all-cause readmission and the composite outcome were obtained for SR and AF patients from 0 to 30 days but only in the composite outcome for SR patients over the longer term. The HR from 0 to 30 days exceeded that from 31 to 365 days for both SR and AF patients. At heart rates {\textless}75, an association was significant for mortality only for both SR and AF patients. CONCLUSIONS Among older patients hospitalized with heart failure, higher discharge heart rate was associated with increased risks of death and rehospitalization, with higher risk in the first 30 days and for SR compared with AF.},

abstract = {I started using R several years ago to analyze data I had collected for my research in graduate school. My motivation at first was to escape from the restrictive environments and canned analyses offered by statistical programs like SPSS. And even better, because it's freely available, I didn't need to convince someone to buy me a copy of the software— very important for a poor graduate student! As I delved deeper into R, I discovered that it could also create excellent data graphics. Each recipe in this book lists a problem and a solution. In most cases, the solutions I offer aren't the only way to do things in R, but they are, in my opinion, the best way. One of the reasons for R's popularity is that there are many available add-on packages, each of which provides some functionality for R. There are many packages for visualizing data in R, but this book primarily uses ggplot2. (Disclaimer: it's now part of my job to do development on ggplot2. However, I wrote much of this book before I had any idea that I would start a job related to ggplot2.) This book isn't meant to be a comprehensive manual of all the different ways of creating data visualizations in R, but hopefully it will help you figure out how to make the graphics you have in mind. Or, if you're not sure what you want to make, browsing its pages may give you some ideas about what's possible.},

abstract = {The purpose of this investigation was to explore an alternative field test to estimate maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) using a one-mile walk test. VO2max was determined in 343 healthy adult (males = 165, females = 178) subjects 30 to 69 yr using a treadmill protocol (mean +/- SD: VO2max = 37.0 +/- 10.7 ml X kg-1 X min-1). Each subject performed a minimum of two, one-mile track walks as fast as possible. The two fastest walks (T1, T2) with elapsed times within 30 s were used for subsequent analyses. Heart rates were monitored continuously and recorded every one-quarter mile. Multiple regression analysis (best sub-sets) to estimate VO2max (l X min-1) yielded the following predictor variables: track walk-1 time (T1); fourth quarter heart rate for track walk-1 (HR 1-4); age (yr); weight (lb); and sex (1 = male, 0 = female). The best equation (N = 174) was: VO2max = 6.9652 + (0.0091*WT) - (0.0257*AGE) + (0.5955*SEX) - (0.2240*T1) - (0.0115*HR1-4); r = 0.93, SEE = 0.325 l X min-1. Comparing observed and estimated VO2max values in a cross-validation group (N = 169) resulted in r = 0.92, SEE = 0.355 l X min-1. Generalized and sex-specific equations to estimate VO2max (ml X kg-1 X min-1) were also generated. The accuracy of estimation as expressed by SEE was similar among the equations. The results indicate that this one-mile walk test protocol provides a valid sub-maximum assessment for VO2max estimation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Relatively limited epidemiological data are available regarding the prognosis of congestive heart failure (CHF) and temporal changes in survival after its onset in a population-based setting. METHODS AND RESULTS Proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the effects of selected clinical variables on survival after the onset of CHF among 652 members of the Framingham Heart Study (51{\%} men; mean age, 70.0 +/- 10.8 years) who developed CHF between 1948 and 1988. Subjects were older at the diagnosis of heart failure in the later decades of this study (mean age at heart failure diagnosis, 57.3 +/- 7.6 years in the 1950s, 65.9 +/- 7.9 years in the 1960s, 71.6 +/- 9.4 years in the 1970s, and 76.4 +/- 10.0 years in the 1980s; p {\textless} 0.001). Median survival after the onset of heart failure was 1.7 years in men and 3.2 years in women. Overall, 1-year and 5-year survival rates were 57{\%} and 25{\%} in men and 64{\%} and 38{\%} in women, respectively. Survival was better in women than in men (age-adjusted hazards ratio for mortality, 0.64; 95{\%} CI, 0.54-0.77). Mortality increased with advancing age in both sexes (hazards ratio for men, 1.27 per decade of age; 95{\%} CI, 1.09-1.47; hazards ratio for women, 1.61 per decade of age; 95{\%} CI, 1.37-1.90). Adjusting for age, there was no significant temporal change in the prognosis of CHF during the 40 years of observation (hazards ratio for men for mortality, 1.08 per calendar decade; 95{\%} CI, 0.92-1.27; hazards ratio for women for mortality, 1.02 per calendar decade; 95{\%} CI, 0.83-1.26). CONCLUSIONS CHF remains highly lethal, with better prognosis in women and in younger individuals. Advances in the treatment of hypertension, myocardial ischemia, and valvular heart disease during the four decades of observation did not translate into appreciable improvements in overall survival after the onset of CHF in this large, unselected population.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to predict energy expenditure (EE) from heart rate (HR) and activity calibrated against 24-h respiration calorimetry in 20 children. HR, oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), and EE were measured during rest, sleep, exercise, and over 24 h by room respiration calorimetry on two separate occasions. Activity was monitored by a leg vibration sensor. The calibration day (day 1) consisted of specified behaviors categorized as inactive (lying, sitting, standing) or active (two bicycle sessions). On the validation day (day 2), the child selected activities. Separate regression equations for VO2, VCO2, and EE for method 1 (combining awake and asleep using HR, HR2, and HR3), method 2 (separating awake and asleep), and method 3 (separating awake into active and inactive, and combining activity and HR) were developed using the calibration data. For day 1, the errors were similar for 24-h VO2, VCO2, and EE among methods and also among HR, HR2, and HR3. The methods were validated using measured data from day 2. There were no significant differences in HR, VO2, VCO2, respiratory quotient, and EE values during rest, sleep, or over the 24 h between days 1 and 2. Applying the linear HR equations to day 2 data, the errors were the lowest with the combined HR/activity method (-2.6 +/- 5.2{\%}, -4.1 +/- 5.9{\%}, -2.9 +/- 5.1{\%} for VO2, VCO2, and EE, respectively). To demonstrate the utility of the HR/activity method, HR and activity were monitored for 24 h at home (day 3). Free-living EE was predicted as 7,410 +/- 1,326 kJ/day. In conclusion, the combination of HR and activity is an acceptable method for determining EE not only for groups of children, but for individuals.},

The value of this approach was investigated in the context of a commercially available patient-controlled analgesia device that has been linked with several alleged patient injuries and deaths. Several reports have stated that errors in programming drug concentration were made during these adverse drug events. A simulation of the commercially available interface was compared experimentally with a simulated prototype of a new interface designed according to a human factors process. Professional nurses, averaging over 5 years of clinical experience with the commercially available interface and only minimal experience with the new interface, programmed both interfaces. The new interface eliminated drug concentration errors, whereas the simulated commercially available interface did not. Also, the new interface led to significantly fewer total errors and faster performance. These findings may have broad implications for the design, regulation, and procurement of biomedical devices, products, or systems that improve patient safety in clinical settings.},

Mean daily VO2 and VCO2 measurements by HR and PA were validated in adults (n = 10 women and 10 men) with room calorimeters. Thirteen linear and nonlinear functions of HR alone and HR combined with PA were tested as models of 24-h VO2 and VCO2. Mean sleep VO2 and VCO2 were similar to basal metabolic rates and were accurately estimated from HR alone [respective mean errors were -0.2 +/- 0.8 (SD) and -0.4 +/- 0.6{\%}]. The range of prediction errors for 24-h VO2 and VCO2 was smallest for a model that used PA to assign HR for each minute to separate active and inactive curves (VO2, -3.3 +/- 3.5{\%}; VCO2, -4.6 +/- 3{\%}). There were no significant correlations between VO2 or VCO2 errors and subject age, weight, fat mass, ration of daily to basal energy expenditure rate, or fitness. VO2, VCO2, and energy expenditure recorded for 3 free-living days were 5.6 +/- 0.9 ml.min-1.kg-1, 4.7 +/- 0.8 ml. min-1.kg-1, and 7.8 +/- 1.6 kJ/min, respectively.

abstract = {Arousal is believed to be needed for upper airway opening in obstructive hypopneas-apneas, without compelling evidence to support this notion. The association may be incidental. I studied the temporal relation between arousal and opening and impact of arousal on flow response at opening in 82 patients (apnea-hypopnea index, 46 +/- 35/hour). Obstructive apneas-hypopneas were induced by dial-down of continuous positive airway pressure. Obstructions and hypopneas occurred in 44 and 56{\%} of dial-downs, respectively. When arousal occurred (83{\%} of dial-downs), the temporal relation between arousal and opening was inconsistent between and within patients. Frequency of opening without or before arousal increased with milder obstructions (p {\textless} 10(-9)) and with delta power of EEG (p {\textless} 10(-6)). Time of opening was unaffected by whether arousal occurred before or after opening (18.0 +/- 9.8 vs. 18.1 +/- 10.5 seconds). Flow response was already excessive when opening occurred without or before arousal (180 +/- 148{\%} of initial flow decline) and was considerably higher when arousal occurred (267 +/- 154{\%}, p {\textless} 10(-10)). Flow undershoot after first ventilatory response was greater if arousal occurred (p {\textless} 0.01). It is concluded that arousals are incidental events that occur when thresholds for arousal and for arousal-independent opening are close. They are not needed to initiate opening or to obtain adequate flow and they likely increase the severity of the disorder by promoting greater ventilatory instability.},

abstract = {Recent research has begun to distinguish two aspects of subjective well-being. Emotional well-being refers to the emotional quality of an individual's everyday experience--the frequency and intensity of experiences of joy, stress, sadness, anger, and affection that make one's life pleasant or unpleasant. Life evaluation refers to the thoughts that people have about their life when they think about it. We raise the question of whether money buys happiness, separately for these two aspects of well-being. We report an analysis of more than 450,000 responses to the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a daily survey of 1,000 US residents conducted by the Gallup Organization. We find that emotional well-being (measured by questions about emotional experiences yesterday) and life evaluation (measured by Cantril's Self-Anchoring Scale) have different correlates. Income and education are more closely related to life evaluation, but health, care giving, loneliness, and smoking are relatively stronger predictors of daily emotions. When plotted against log income, life evaluation rises steadily. Emotional well-being also rises with log income, but there is no further progress beyond an annual income of {\~{}}{\$}75,000. Low income exacerbates the emotional pain associated with such misfortunes as divorce, ill health, and being alone.

abstract = {Foreword One characteristic of the healthcare field is its constant and extremely fast technological development. While in the past its progress relied on expertise coming mostly from medicine, today it receives contributions from many different areas of research such as electronics, chemistry, biology, physics, mathematics, mechanical engineering, materials engineering, and informatics. Such fast development has produced an immense variety of well-accepted equipment and medical procedures for diagnosis and therapy. However, it also requires the development, transference and adaptation of safety programs, formerly developed in other industries, to be implemented in medical procedures as well as equipment operation, equipment design and production, hospital interoperability, medical records, cloud storage, and so on. Clinical engineers, used to dealing mostly with medical equipment management techniques, found themselves overwhelmed by safety demands associated with the use of such technologies. Worse, few academics worldwide are familiar with safety programs applied to the healthcare area. As one of the participants in the implementation of the academic curriculum for Clinical Engineering training courses, and the coordinator of one such training course for more than 20 years in Brazil, I am excited by the release of this book, explaining the practical use of safety tools by clinical engineers and technologists. As a researcher and supervisor of a post-graduate Biomedical Engineering program at the University of Campinas for more than 30 years, I had several opportunities to discuss with my students and coordinators of Clinical Engineering training courses, subjects regarding risk management for the healthcare area. These discussions were about the urgent need to include safety tools and programs dedicated to healthcare environments within our Clinical Engineering academic program. Despite our belief of the urgency of this work, it was extremely difficult to find instructors familiar with this subject. The ones we found, despite great knowledge on very efficient safety tools, had no idea how to translate them to the healthcare area for practical use. It is important to mention that my participation as chairman of the Clinical Engineering Division of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering – CED/IFMBE, showed me that this is not just a local problem but a worldwide lack of knowledge.},

Three infusion pumps from different vendors were involved in the evaluation, which consisted of two phases: a human factors heuristic assessment of the pumps according to several criteria, and user testing in five clinical areas. The clinical areas were: Oncology, Medical/Surgical, Pediatric, ICU, and Anaesthesiology. Fourteen nurses and three anaesthetists participated in the user testing. Reasonable agreement was observed between results of both phases of the evaluation, and overall results clearly favoured one of the infusion pumps over the others.

abstract = {The New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system was developed to help physicians in clinical practice evaluate the effect of cardiac symptoms on a patient's daily activities. Over time, the role of the NYHA classification system has expanded, and it is now frequently used in clinical research. This review of the literature was undertaken to explore whether the NYHA classes have sufficient validity and reliability to serve as a functional outcome measure in research studies. After exploring its strengths and limitations, we conclude that the NYHA classes are a valid measure of functional status, a concept that is distinct from functional capacity and functional performance. The reproducibility of the NYHA functional classification system has not been established in the literature. Researchers are urged to report the methods for determining NYHA class, the training of raters, and the intra-rater or inter-rater reliability in studies that have multiple raters or measurements. Until the reliability of the NYHA functional classification system is determined, it is prudent to refrain from using the NYHA classes as the sole outcome measure of change in function in research studies of cardiac patients.},

We therefore prospectively tested the reproducibility and validity of the New York Heart Association criteria and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society criteria for the assessment of cardiac functional class and compared these criteria with a new Specific Activity Scale based on the metabolic costs of specific activities. The New York Heart Association estimates made by two physicians had a reproducibility of only 56{\%}, and only 51{\%} of the estimates agreed with treadmill exercise performance. Functional estimates based on the Canadian Cardiovascular Society criteria were significantly more reproducible (73{\%}), but not significantly more valid. The Specific Activity Scale was as reproducible as the Canadian Cardiovascular Society criteria, and its 68{\%} validity was significantly higher than the validities of the other systems. The easily administered Specific Activity Scale was equally reproducible and valid when used by a nonphysician. It was especially better than the other systems for the evaluation of true class II patients and was significantly less likely to underestimate treadmill performance. Although no set of questions can perfectly predict exercise tolerance, the Specific Activity Scale deserves wider prospective testing.},

Swallowing sounds recorded from the trachea have been suggested as a noninvasive method of swallowing assessment. However, acquiring signals from the trachea can be difficult for those with loose skin. The objective of this pilot study was to explore the viability of using the ear and nose as alternative recording locations for recording swallowing sounds. We recorded the swallowing and breathing sounds of five healthy young individuals from the ear, nose and trachea, simultaneously. We computed time-frequency features and compared them for the different locations of recording. The features included the peak and the maximum frequencies of the power spectrum density, average power at different frequency bands and the wavelet coefficients. The average power calculated over the 4 octave bands between 150 and 2,400 Hz showed a consistent trend with less than 20 dB difference for the breath sounds of all the recording locations. Thus, analyzing breath sounds recorded from the ear and nose for the purpose of aspiration detection would give similar results to those from tracheal recordings; thus, ear and nose recording may be a viable alternative when tracheal recording is not possible.},

abstract = {Background: In 2008, the United States spent {\$}2.2 trillion for healthcare, which was 15.5{\%} of its GDP. 31{\%} of this expenditure is attributed to hospital care. Evidently, even modest reductions in hospital care costs matter. A 2009 study showed that nearly {\$}30.8 billion in hospital care cost during 2006 was potentially preventable, with heart diseases being responsible for about 31{\%} of that amount. Methods: Our goal is to accurately and efficiently predict heart-related hospitalizations based on the available patient-specific medical history. To the best of our knowledge, the approaches we introduce are novel for this problem. The prediction of hospitalization is formulated as a supervised classification problem. We use de-identified Electronic Health Record (EHR) data from a large urban hospital in Boston to identify patients with heart diseases. Patients are labeled and randomly partitioned into a training and a test set. We apply five machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), AdaBoost using trees as the weak learner, logistic regression, a na??ve Bayes event classifier, and a variation of a Likelihood Ratio Test adapted to the specific problem. Each model is trained on the training set and then tested on the test set. Results: All five models show consistent results, which could, to some extent, indicate the limit of the achievable prediction accuracy. Our results show that with under 30{\%} false alarm rate, the detection rate could be as high as 82{\%}. These accuracy rates translate to a considerable amount of potential savings, if used in practice.},

abstract = {Tracheal respiratory sound analysis is a simple, inexpensive and non-invasive way to study the pathology of the upper airways. Recently, it has attracted considerable attention for acoustical flow estimation and investigation of obstruction in the upper airways. Obstructive sleep apena (OSA) is characterized by periods of reduction or complete cessation of airflow during sleep. However, the flow-sound relationship is highly variable among OSA and non-OSA individuals; it also changes for the same person at different body postures and during wake and sleep. In this study we recorded respiratory sound and flow from 93 non-OSA individuals as well as 13 OSA patients during sleep and wake. We investigated the statistical correlation between the flow-sound model parameters and anthropometric features in the non-OSA group. The results have shown that gender, height and smoking are the most significant factors that affect the model parameters. We compared the flow-sound relationship in OSA and non-OSA groups in the sitting position while awake. We also examined the variations in the model parameters in OSA patients during sleep and wake in the recumbent position. The results show that the model parameters are different in the two groups even when accounted for height, gender and position. In OSA group, the model parameters change from wake to sleep, even at the same position. The variations in the model parameters can be used to investigate the characteristics of upper airways and examine the factors that can lead to the upper airways obstruction during sleep.},

Pressure ulcers are a leading iatrogenic cause of death in developed countries and significantly impact quality of life for those affected. Pressure ulcers will be an increasing public health concern as the population ages. Electronic information systems are being explored to improve consistency and accuracy of documentation, improve patient and caregiver experience and ultimately improve patient outcomes. A software application was developed for Android Smartphones and tablets and was trialed in a personal care home in Western Canada. The software application provides an electronic medical record for chronic wounds, replacing nurses' paper-based charting and is positioned for integration with facility's larger eHealth framework. The mHealth application offers three intended benefits over paper-based charting of chronic wounds, including: (1) the capacity for remote consultation (telehealth between facilities, practitioners, and/or remote communities), (2) data organization and analysis, including built-in alerts, automatically-generated text-based and graph-based wound histories including wound images, and (3) tutorial support for non-specialized caregivers. The user trial yielded insights regarding the software application's design and functionality in the clinical setting, and highlighted the key role of wound photographs in enhancing patient and caregiver experiences, enhancing communication between multiple healthcare professionals, and leveraging the software's telehealth capacities.},

abstract = {Recent advances in the MEMS devices make it happen to wirelessly integrate miniature motion capturing devices with Smartphones and to use them in personal health care and physical activity monitoring in daily life. There is no ground truth, though, to measure the physical activity (PA) in daily life and because of this, there is no common validation procedure adapted by the researchers for benchmarking the performance of algorithms for PA classification. The major issue in the existing studies for PA classification is the utilization of structured protocol in a controlled setting or simulated daily environment, which limits their implementation in real life conditions where activities are unplanned and unstructured, both in occurrence and in duration. This study provides a critical review on the validation procedures used for PA classification, types of activities classified and limitations in the exiting studies to implement them in daily life settings. Only those studies are considered which classify PA based on wearable accelerometers as an objective measure. The pros and cons of existing methodologies are highlighted and future possibilities are addressed for the development of a robust PA classification system which is feasible under real life conditions.},

abstract = {The contributions of pharyngeal mechanical abnormalities, flow demand, and compensatory effectiveness to obstructive sleep apnea severity were determined in 82 patients. Flow demand was estimated from mean inspiratory flow on continuous positive airway pressure. Mechanical load on upper airway muscles was estimated from minimal effective continuous positive airway pressure, flow demand, and minimum flow observed during brief pressure dial downs. Compensatory effectiveness was estimated by relating polysomnographic severity and mechanical load. Mechanical load was more severe in men, in supine position, and in older and heavier patients. Higher flow demand contributed significantly to mechanical load in men and in those who are obese. At the same mechanical load, severity was independent of age, sex, or body mass index but was greater in the supine position and in REM sleep. Mechanical load accounted for only 34{\%} of variability in severity. Eighty-two percent of patients experienced periods of stable breathing despite mechanical loads that would produce continuous cycling without compensation. I conclude that most patients can adequately compensate for the abnormal mechanics, at least part of the time. Higher flow demand contributes to severity in men and in obesity. Severity is largely due to factors other than mechanical load. Compensatory effectiveness is impaired in the supine position and in REM sleep, but not by age, sex, or body mass index.},

abstract = {Flow estimation from respiratory sounds, in particular tracheal sounds, has drawn much attention in recent years. This article briefly discusses previous studies that have been proposed for flow estimation. Recently, a method based on entropy was shown to have a superior performance compared to the other methods. The robustness of this entropy-based model in terms of its sensitivity to the changes of the tracheal sound signal's amplitude is presented here. Furthermore, with the aid of a new and simple technique to cancel the effect of heart sounds on the tracheal sound, the method was also able to estimate flow at very shallow breathing, which had not been done in previous studies. Flow variation effects the amplitude of tracheal sound. Therefore, the robustness of any flow estimation method to amplitude and the entropy method in particular is of interest},

Using a large longitudinal university-employer-employee dataset, we find that the cost of recessions for new graduates is substantial and unequal. Unlucky graduates suffer persistent earnings declines lasting ten years. They start to work for lower paying employers, and then partly recover through a gradual process of mobility toward better firms. We document that more advantaged graduates suffer less from graduating in recessions because they switch to better firms quickly, while earnings of less advantaged graduates can be permanently affected by cyclical downgrading.

abstract = {The effects of training and/or ageing upon maximal oxygen uptake ({\_} V O 2max) and heart rate values at rest (HR rest) and maximal exercise (HR max), respec-tively, suggest a relationship between {\_} V O 2max and the HR max -to-HR rest ratio which may be of use for indirect testing of {\_} V O 2max . Fick principle calculations supple-mented by literature data on maximum-to-rest ratios for stroke volume and the arterio-venous O 2 difference suggest that the conversion factor between mass-specific {\_} V O 2max (mlAEmin)1 AEkg)1) and HR max AEHR rest)1 is {\$}15. In the study we experimentally examined this relationship and evaluated its potential for prediction of {\_} V O 2max . {\_} V O 2max was measured in 46 well-trained men (age 21– 51 years) during a treadmill protocol. A subgroup (n=10) demonstrated that the proportionality factor between HR max AEHR rest)1 and mass-specific {\_} V O 2max was 15.3 (0.7) mlAEmin)1 AEkg)1 . Using this value, {\_} V O 2max in the remaining 36 individuals could be estimated with an SEE of 0.21 lAEmin)1 or 2.7 mlAEmin)1 AEkg)1 ({\$}4.5{\%}). This compares favourably with other common indirect tests. When replacing measured HR max with an age-predicted one, SEE was 0.37 lAEmin)1 and 4.7 mlAEmin)1 AEkg)1 ({\$}7.8{\%}), which is still comparable with other indirect tests. We conclude that the HR max -to-HR rest ratio may provide a tool for estimation of {\_} V O 2max in well-trained men. The applicability of the test principle in relation to other groups will have to await direct validation. {\_} V O 2max can be estimated indirectly from the measured HR max -to-HR rest ratio with an accuracy that compares favour-ably with that of other common indirect tests. The re-sults also suggest that the test may be of use for {\_} V O 2max estimation based on resting measurements alone.},

abstract = {Large, production quality distributed systems still fail periodically, and do so sometimes catastrophically, where most or all users experience an outage or data loss. We present the result of a comprehensive study investigating 198 randomly selected, user-reported failures that occurred on Cassandra, HBase, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Hadoop MapReduce, and Redis, with the goal of understanding how one or multiple faults eventually evolve into a user-visible failure. We found that from a testing point of view, almost all failures require only 3 or fewer nodes to reproduce, which is good news considering that these services typically run on a very large number of nodes. However, multiple inputs are needed to trigger the failures with the order between them being important. Finally, we found the error logs of these systems typically contain sufficient data on both the errors and the input events that triggered the failure, enabling the diagnose and the reproduction of the production failures. We found the majority of catastrophic failures could easily have been prevented by performing simple testing on error handling code – the last line of defense – even without an understanding of the software design. We extracted three simple rules from the bugs that have lead to some of the catastrophic failures, and developed a static checker, Aspirator, capable of locating these bugs. Over 30{\%} of the catastrophic failures would have been prevented had Aspirator been used and the identified bugs fixed. Running Aspirator on the code of 9 distributed systems located 143 bugs and bad practices that have been fixed or confirmed by the developers.},

abstract = {Tracheal respiratory sound analysis is a simple and non-invasive way to study the pathophysiology of the upper airway and has recently been used for acoustic estimation of respiratory flow and sleep apnea diagnosis. However in none of the previous studies was the respiratory flow-sound relationship studied in people with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), nor during sleep. In this study, we recorded tracheal sound, respiratory flow, and head position from eight non-OSA and 10 OSA individuals during sleep and wakefulness. We compared the flow-sound relationship and variations in model parameters from wakefulness to sleep within and between the two groups. The results show that during both wakefulness and sleep, flow-sound relationship follows a power law but with different parameters. Furthermore, the variations in model parameters may be representative of the OSA pathology. The other objective of this study was to examine the accuracy of respiratory flow estimation algorithms during sleep: we investigated two approaches for calibrating the model parameters using the known data recorded during either wakefulness or sleep. The results show that the acoustical respiratory flow estimation parameters change from wakefulness to sleep. Therefore, if the model is calibrated using wakefulness data, although the estimated respiratory flow follows the relative variations of the real flow, the quantitative flow estimation error would be high during sleep. On the other hand, when the calibration parameters are extracted from tracheal sound and respiratory flow recordings during sleep, the respiratory flow estimation error is less than 10{\%}.},

These tools utilize composite shape memory alloy (SMA), shape memory polymer (SMP) and combinations of SMA and SMP to produce catheter distal tips, actuators, etc., which are bistable. Applications for these structures include: 1) a method for reversible fine positioning of a catheter tip, 2) a method for reversible fine positioning of tools or therapeutic catheters by a guide catheter, 3) a method for bending articulation through the body's vasculature, 4) methods for controlled stent delivery, deployment, and repositioning, and 5) catheters with variable modulus, with vibration mode, with inchworm capability, and with articulated tips. These actuators and catheter tips are bistable and are opportune for in vivo usage because the materials are biocompatible and convenient for intravascular use as well as other minimal by invasive techniques.},

@article{Attal2015,
abstract = {This paper presents a review of different classification techniques used to recognize human activities from wearable inertial sensor data. Three inertial sensor units were used in this study and were worn by healthy subjects at key points of upper/lower body limbs (chest, right thigh and left ankle). Three main steps describe the activity recognition process: sensors' placement, data pre-processing and data classification. Four supervised classification techniques namely, k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and Random Forest (RF) as well as three unsupervised classification techniques namely, k-Means, Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM), are compared in terms of correct classification rate, F-measure, recall, precision, and specificity. Raw data and extracted features are used separately as inputs of each classifier. The feature selection is performed using a wrapper approach based on the RF algorithm. Based on our experiments, the results obtained show that the k-NN classifier provides the best performance compared to other supervised classification algorithms, whereas the HMM classifier is the one that gives the best results among unsupervised classification algorithms. This comparison highlights which approach gives better performance in both supervised and unsupervised contexts. It should be noted that the obtained results are limited to the context of this study, which concerns the classification of the main daily living human activities using three wearable accelerometers placed at the chest, right shank and left ankle of the subject.},

In clinical settings and using the Holter monitor as the reference, participants exercised on a stationary bike for 10 minutes with 10-watts step protocol. The two devices reported better correlation with the Holter monitor at higher workload levels, hence, at higher heart rate with a 90{\%} confidence interval for overall measurement accuracy. We also examined the feasibility of the two devices in remote monitoring 8 heart failure patients (NYHA II-NYHA III) for two weeks. The two devices reported lower daily physical activity, lower total step count and higher resting heart rate for NYHA III patients when compared to NYHA II patients' data.},

abstract = {New graduates of elite MBA programs flock to Wall Street during bull markets and start their careers elsewhere when the stock market is weak. Given the transferability of MBA skills, it seems likely that any effect of stock returns on MBA placement would be short-lived. In this paper, I use a survey of Stanford MBAs from the classes of 1960 through 1997 to analyze the relationship between the state of financial market at graduation, initial job placement, and long- term labor market outcomes. Using stock market conditions at graduation as an instrument for first job, I show that there is a strong causal effect of initial placement in investment banking on the likelihood of working on Wall Street anywhere from three to twenty years later. I then measure the investment banking compensation premium relative to other jobs and estimate the additional income generated by anMBA cohort where a higher fraction starts in higher-paid jobs relative to a cohort that starts in lower-paid areas. The results lead to several conclusions. First, random factors play an important role in determining the industries and incomes of members of this high-skill group. Second, there is a deep pool of potential investment bankers in any given Stanford MBA class. During the time these people are in school, factors beyond their control sort them into or out of banking upon graduation. Finally, industry-specificortask-specific human capital appears to be important for young investment bankers.},
